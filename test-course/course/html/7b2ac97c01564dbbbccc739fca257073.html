<p>The <strong>randomizeÂ </strong>block is a poorly supported, undocumented, built-in XBlock which can only be configured via OLX. All it does is randomly show one of its children to each user. The choice should be stable for a user once they load the block for the first time. See the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/xmodule/randomize_block.py">source code</a> for more details.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please Note:</strong></em> Do not confuse this with the <em>Randomized Content Block</em>, which is the user-facing name for the legacy <strong>library_content</strong> block.</p>
